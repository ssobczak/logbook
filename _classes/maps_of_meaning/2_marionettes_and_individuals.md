Fundamental problem: how to behave in the world and in relation to others in order to survive in the future. One way of solving this problem is dominance hierarchy. It's older than trees (300M years). It's been around for the longest, so it's the most real.

This is engrained in procedural memory, where you can store things you don't know about (for example how to behave in social situations - you don't know why you did something).

Two people that share the same culture can interact by following each other's expectations even though they don't really know each other well.

It's not believes that regulate emotions - it's the match between the belief system and the way everyone else is working. People are willing to fight to protect their belief & social structure, because that protects them from from death anxiety and death itself.

Is nature good and culture corrupting, or the other way around? It's both - people created culture, so can't blame everything just on culture.

You're good and calm because you're not hungry and not cold. Hypothalamus is a primitive structure in the brain regulating things like hunger, thirst etc. People with misfuction can drown themselves when drinking. Hypothalamus can get you to do terrible things, that's part of PTSD - young soldiers are shocked by what they can do.

Between ages of 2 and 4 humans learn how to get the bag of entities that we have inside to be one coherent being.

[Story of his son sitting on the stairs until he got control of himself]. People don't like their children, because they're not civilized (yet). You need to reward the kid for behaving good way - if you teach them how to behave so that you like them, other people (and kids) will like them too. Reward people close to you for when they're doing things that you like - reward is a much better behavior influencer than punishment.

By the age of 3 child should be integrated enough to focus on a single activity for a longer period of time. Playing roles is important - to play the role of mother you need to understand what being mother is. It's not imitation - they generalize. Language is imitation too. From infancy - breastfeeding is a play and a complicated social interaction.

Cooperation and competition is very similar - hockey has more agreements than competition, usually can't separate them.

There's a set of all games and winning across all of them (the meta-game) is to be invited to all the games. It's true across all cultures - single games are different, but overall they're very similar. People are really good ad remembering cheaters - human is adopted to play the meta-game. The goal of a single game usually is to establish hierarchy.

You don't obtain satisfaction from reaching the goal, but from working towards one.

Naturist myth (avatar) - nature is pristine and people are destroying it. There's a second half of that story - the frontier, explorers discovering and settling new lands. Things are themselves and their own opposites too. You need to be both if you want to be successful. The same goes about heroes - one needs to be monster to be virtuous. A rabbit is not virtuous, it's just passive. Developing (and controlling) your monster makes you a better person, not worse.

### Part 2

We're incredibly technologically advanced, but we're not wise yet (morally). You need to understand yourself as a monster to be able to control your behavior. Lack of money shields you from problems - partially because we're already rich, but also because you can't afford some temptations.

How to set a good goal? It needs to be high above the mundane. Everyone can set a good goal. People choose not to have a meaningful life, because it means adopting a lot of responsibility and without that you can do whatever you want. For example "nothing human is foreign to me" - anything that others did, I could do too. This is a lot of responsibility.

The best way to orient yourself in life is to orient yourself to the highest goal you can imagine and good things will happen to you.

Sometimes worthy actions don't have to be recognized (story of the poor woman that would take mental patients for a walk with her dog). There are opportunities for elevating your actions, wherever you are.

If you don't know what you should be doing, have a chat with yourself, ask what you should quit doing. If you do this 100x, you'll be in a good place.

Quality (of things) is integrity - a thing that does what it's supposed to do and does it well.

Conscience doesn't know everything - it's a guide, sometimes smarter than you. It's a society in your head, often gives you good hints, but you don't have to listen to it. It has a lot of generic advice, but also needs to be personalized and molded.

Scientific approach says that you are a deterministic product of culture and nature. But the oldest stories say that you're a separate entity and you can change your destiny. We also behave like that, our entire legal system assumes that, but so far we have no way of accounting for that.

In the book of creation god "tells" things to "be" form chaos. Gepetto gives Pinokio a voice, which is important - when you want to do something you need a plan, you voice it first and then execute.
