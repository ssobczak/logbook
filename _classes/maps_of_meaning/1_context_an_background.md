Every generation has it's worries. His was nuclear war.

When people are trading, Pareto distribution always appears. This happens in monopoly, is societies  (1%), in book sales (Stephen King is on top of every book stand), points in hockey.

Status is important for men (more than women). There's a threshold of poverty and if the society doesn't have a way to go up, the more aggressive men will turn to crime. Drug dealers don't make a lot of money, but the gangs offer a chance to advance in the hierarchy. This is important if the society doesn't offer a way to advance.

Money isn't necessarily helpful - drug addicts go back into drugs when they only get some money.

Poverty follows IQ. It's hard to increase - people hope that practicing one skill will generalize to other areas. It doesn't work this way. Top IQ will be around the opportunity. Bottom will have problems functioning, especially as the society becomes more tech. advanced and complex. [Lengthy story about a guy folding letters.]

During cold war people were going trough really hard times and were ready to sacrifice their lives and lives of many other people to fight for ideas. It's amazing how our society nowadays provides everything we need. Water, power, shelter. People are good to each other, but that's because there's no need for brutality.

Question: why would people have two camps with tons of hydrogen bombs aiming at each other and risk destruction of the world? Economists assume that people compete for resources, but why do we value things like gold? Why people risk their own death and death of others for a belief system?

The important thing is not the system, but match between how people act (what you want) and what's expected of them. You can call that familiar and unexplored territory. For social humans the territory is the dominance hierarchy of other humans. Our territories is temporal (time + space). When the match between expectation and what happens breaks, we act as prey animals - freeze / be "invisible".

Society isn't a formal theory - it's the match between your belief and other people's beliefs and how they act. If everyone follows the same beliefs, they act in predictable ways and you can get what you want.

Every action, even looking is based on moral guidelines. You don't pay attention to patterns on the carpet, because it's not important. It has no emotional significance and no value. Why are you here? You want to get a degree, be smart, get a good job, start a family etc. Because of all that simultaneously you know what to pay attention to - the teacher.

Value systems guide your perception and guide your actions. You don't know all your values and you're a collection of different entities (loosely integrated).

Assumption: what actually happens to us is real. "You can't derive ought from is." - you don't have all the information, you don't know what is more important. Spend money on healing aids or higher education?

The thousands of years of christianity helped to build a foundation for the current belief system. Human rights stem from the idea that every person have something extremely valuable in them, even if you're convicted. The presumption of innocence is artificial unbelievable. It's not scientific, but highly functional - societies that made the law subject to individual are much more successful than others. Nietsche announced the death of god and since then there's more and more cracks in the foundation of the society.

Pragmatic truths - truths that have practical utility. Don't necessarily have to be logically true, but it works.

Human beings have a central narrative, which is built on our internal set of values, which are built into us. Humans are not infinitely malleable (opposed to what post-modernists say).

Great dramas are hyper-real - provide guidelines on how to act and are applicable to whole range of situations. Good story provides a guideline on how to behave in unexplored territory - this is interesting and cheap wisdom. Chaos is when effects of what you don't match what you were expecting (or you don't know what effects to expect).

Fiction is distilled from the mundane truth and possibly integrated multiple stories to take different perspectives on the situation. Pinokio is not real (a series of drawings), plot is absurd - a cricket is consciousness, main character is a doll etc., but it doesn't matter - the story is hyper-real.

What's the meaning of life? Adoption of responsibility. For example you'll take care of your little sister - nobody is questioning if that's meaningful. Friendship is responsibility, having a career too. We're beasts of burden and we need load, but what kind?

People don't act as if facts were real - scientists constructed hydrogen bombs that could wipe the planet, but people didn't act like the treat was real. Existentialism - you can tell what people are like by how they act. Pain is real - people in pain always act as if the pain was real. Buddhism agrees, christian god is crucified (a bunch of pain), jwes celebrate all historical pain. Part of meaning of life is to alleviate some pain (own, or others).

Humans are the only animal that invented time. Real self consciousness is knowing own borders in space and time, given that time is finite.

Stories told for thousand years are interesting - all that's left is what's important - that's what people tend to remember. Not necessarily understandable - music is like that, good movies too - mean more than you can understand. We're nested inside moral systems, which are based on narratives (dramas). Moral systems are what orients us in lives and the reason to understand them is that you need to know how to live.

Aushwitz prisoners carrying salt back and forth is really bad, because it's harnessing the human compulsion to engage in meaningful activity and demonstrating that it's absolutely useless.

Was the difference between communism and western culture arbitrary and was it going to be settled by force? Socialism is based on abstract ideas, western culture is evolved from very old stories. It's worthy to study those stories.

Mother nature and father culture. Culture is judging your reputation (meta-person watching you). Nature is destructive and creative. Culture is tyrannical - you need to shape yourself to fit in and sacrifice a part of who you are, but it's also provides order. Individual is in the middle of all that, has limited scope, has two sides too - hero and a villain.

Knowledge of good and evil comes from being self conscious. If you're self conscious, you can be empathic - if it hurts me, it will hurt her - and you know good and evil.

"Panzram A Journal of Murder" - autobiography of a man aimed at destruction.

You can ask yourself a question about what do you think is admirable (not thing - asking is different) and parts of answer will float up. You'll learn about what your internal faculty values, because you admire people that you want to be similar to.

It's hard to specify what you want, because you also specify conditions of failure, which is hard. You can't hit anything if you're not aiming at anything.

If you have old memories that make you emotional, you still haven't solved the problem. Writing helps to take it apart and deconstruct it. Writing produces short term decremental effects, and long term improvements.

You want to have a family, friends and useful job. But what you want from them? What you want from your job? The idea that you'll be happy once you've solved all your problems is not true - once you're done with university you're unemployed and looking at a job at Starbucks.
