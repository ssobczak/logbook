It's important to understand the changes happening in society before genocide to remember and learn the lesson. What happens often is that one group of people gets their sense of being victim increased. Then the genocide is covered by empathy on behalf of the opressed.

For example in Russia, when communism came kulak class was more successful and would produce most of the food. Communist intellectuals came and convinced unsuccessful people that they were victimized by the successful farmers and they should be sent to Siberia. This was the reason for hunger in Ukraine.

Tragedy gives lives negative meaning. Everyone agrees, even nihilists - but they say there's nothing transcendent that can be set opposing the suffering. Nobody thinks and especially acts as if life was meaningless - that would just be neutral.

Positive emotion system is activated when you proceed towards a set goal. There's two types of rewards - consummatory (eliminates the value framework, after you eat there's no need to eat any more) and incentive reward.

The higher the goal you set for yourself, the bigger dopamine kick you'll get once you move towards it. Also it's likely that you'll get more dopamine the more load/responsibility you take. It's possible that the meaning of life comes from how much responsibility are you willing to take (which comes from how high a goal are you working towards).

The most pathological behavior (according to the movie) is to abandon all responsibility and go to impulsive pleasure seeking.

A child should be pushed to the limits of responsibility they can take when they're not feeling well to learn how much they can actually do and not to get confused themselves on if they can actually do anything and not given some setbacks.

Mandala is a symbol of self, source of meaning and development of the self. It's like a "slice" of development timeline.

Every ideal is a judge, because it shows you what you could be, but you're not.

5% of criminals commit 90% of the crimes - another Pareto distribution.

Sometimes people maintain a tyrannical relationship with their fathers, just to keep around someone that knows better what to do.

When you orient your vision towards something, your brain will literally see things that are needed for achieving the goal and will not see unrelated things. Your perception differs depending on the goal.

The thing you most desire is in the place where you least want to look. King Arthur's knights when looking for the holy grail, enter the forrest in the places that look the darkest for them. When the pursuit pushes you just to the limit, there's the best things to be gained there.

It's a common mythological theme that when the hero goes to confront his fears, the moment he actually sees it, he freezes and runs away, because it turned out to be far worse than what he imagined.
