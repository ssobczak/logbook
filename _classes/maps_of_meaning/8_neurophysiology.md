Our senses and perception is tuned to a particular scale. We operate in time of between 0.1 sec and 3 years, distance of touch-able (millimeters) to walk-able (10 km) etc. The same is true for cognitive categories - children will distinguish cat from a dog, but not two different species of a cat. Those are the basic categories.

Are categories / abstractions more real than the objects itself? Are numbers real? Most real?

Complex objects and characters always have good & bad side. Nature, culture, people can be good and the opposite at the same time. If you know that, it's a good countermeasure to ideology - you'll know that parts of the story are missing.

You can't understand anything fully. People are more complex than our representation. Even our creations - Car for Henry Ford was just a means of transportation, but it turned out to be a way to transform atmosphere and a carrier of political ideas, like individualism.

Females in humans are selecting mates. Historically on average each woman had one child, half of man had two and other half had none. That's why nature is represented as female - nature is the thing that selects.

Your senses are always biased, because you need to actively sense something (you focus your vision, you filter sounds). Senses are never independent, it's always a loop - you start with a low resolution knower, low resolution category system and low resolution senses / world.

Body is mapped on a brain twice: as input (sensory) and as output (motoric). Representation of amount of brain tissue (resolution) is called homunculus - both input and output has a lot of resolution on mouth / tongue and hands, input has more in feet and genitals too.
