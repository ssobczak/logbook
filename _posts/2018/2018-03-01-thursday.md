## Why is a kettle louder before it boils?
[Thunderf00t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fszYVWNmJ0Q)

Water vapor pressure in vacuum is only 0.02atm. If water is closed in vacuum, it will rattle when shaken, creating cavitation bubbles and collapsing them.

In kettle, steam bubbles are created just by the hot plate. They will collapse when in contact with colder water. The maximum noise is at 70C.

The lifetime of water vapor bubbles in ~1ms. There are also "permanent" bubbles by the hot plate - made of oxygen & nitrogen, as their solubility in water drops as the water is heated.
