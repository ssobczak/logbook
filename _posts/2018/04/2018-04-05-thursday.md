## Ether review
[Podcast #1 - Legal](https://soundcloud.com/arthurfalls)
- Bitcoin is perceived as drug money
- In Australia they moved on, use mostly ETH which is not related to darkweb
- Illegal - first adopters, they need good tools because no system is protecting them / they’re against the system and need sth better
  - Example: nascar used to be alcohol smuggling, running from the police

  - Rent for a day
  - Uber-like
  - Auto-deduct taxes, can track where the tax dollars went
- Decrease of entry barrier: right now if you want to start taxi company, you need marketing etc
- Industry used to be “how to manufacture a lot of this product for people for cheap” to “how to make this platform to allow people provide products and services for each other”. This is not totally done yet.
- Value of products
  - Arbitrage market will render anything that can be provided virtually for free actually free
  - Art - you buy T-Shirt / CD / concert to publicly show support, support badge system / status is interesting psycho- and sociologically
