## Why leaders eat last?
Simon Sinek

Hormones modifying behavior:
- Endorphins - mask physical pain, for example on a marathon
- Dopamine - accomplished a goal / made step towards one. BTW, make tangible goals to see the progress and get dopamine. It's highly addictive.

In organization leaders define who is inside / outside the trusted circle. "inner-circle", or include everyone.

- Serotonin - bonding when celebrating accomplishments. Released for both: the player and the coach. That's why we have accomplishment ceremonies and winners always say "I couldn't do this alone"

Social hierarchies - good system for group survival. We're OK with leaders earning more money, but we're really don't like when leaders don't protect members of their team. Bankers in 2008 "sold out" people, but the same size bonus to Nelson Mandela sounds fair.

- Oxytocin - love, trust, friendship. Released trough altruistic acts of generosity (doesn't work when you gain something). Also touch, hugs etc. Must put in time and effort (not money). Trust takes time to build - can't marry after a week of dating, also probably should after 7 years. Stops dopamine from being addictive.
Can release by replying to an email in person, or at least call.

- Cortisol - stress. Inhibits oxytocin, shuts down many non-essential systems (immunity?).
