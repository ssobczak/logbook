## Hawking radiation
[Part of BBC video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6srN4idq1E)

Particles of matter and antimatter get created spontaneously throughout the universe.
When one is created at the event horizon of a black hole, the antimatter falls in and the matter particle flies away. This is Hawking Radiation. It evaporates black holes.

## 5 Possibilities for Interstellar Travel

- Fusion - drop nukes behind the ship. Fusion uses only 1% energy stored in a mass.
- Antimatter - produced in CERN, speed of 0.5c shoud be possible
- Light sail - 0.1c should be possible. Big laser is needed and slowing down is a problem.
- Black hole drive - making the black hole requires really big lasers

## The Kugelblitz: A Black Hole Made From Light

Black hole can be made from light, following the $m=e/{c^2}$. It should be a size of 6 attometers (a proton) ant pack 600B tonnes of mass to optimize Hawking ratiation. It would live ~3.5 years if not fed with new mass.

## Dyson sphere

Sphere around a star that harvests it's energy.
It should be a swarm not to collapse. It could be made from Mercury's iron core converted to hematite (highly reflective, used as primitive mirrors).

There is a set of more and less popular numbers that show up in Encyclopedia Of Integer Series. These are usually primes, $n^2$, close to $2^n$ etc. -  numbers more liked by mathematicians.

## Google Maps auto-extracting data
[Article](https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-moat)

Google has very precise satellite data and fly-over data. It extracts building features and location from it. The process is automated and sometimes buildings are on the map before streets.

They also extract business names and locations from street view data. Overlay this with buildings and this gives them precise locations. Then they build "areas of interest" by highlighting areas with high concentration of building including shops and cafes. All automated.

Overall this gives them 5-6 years of advantage over Apple, TomTom and others.

## Tesla battery in Australia helps to stabilize network after coal unit tripped
[Article](http://reneweconomy.com.au/tesla-big-battery-outsmarts-lumbering-coal-units-after-loy-yang-trips-70003/)

Big coal unit tripped in Australia. Tesla battery picked up drop in the frequency in milliseconds and helped to stabilize it way before the plant contracted to respond kicked in (6 s). The battery was not even contracted to do it.
