## Fake pro-repeal net neutrality comments

[Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6)

Interesting analysis of unique-ness of comments for net neutrality. Dataset and notebook published on Kaggle.

Analysis - first deduplicate comments, from 22M to 3M using MD5, then turned to word-vectors using [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and compared using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/vectors-similarity). Then clustered using [DBSCAN](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#dbscan).

DBSCAN - clusters can be any shape, as opposed to k-means, which assumes clusters are convex-shaped. Finds core samples and their neighbors, within *eps* distance from them. Core sample needs to have at least *min_samples* around them.

[HDBSCAN](http://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) - DBSCAN over multiple epsilons and returns clustering stable across different epsilon values.

Astro-turfing - word from fake grass to describe fake grassroots-imitation campaigns.
