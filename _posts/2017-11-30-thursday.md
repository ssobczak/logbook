## VASMIR engine

[YT lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5Pars7ONdw&t=3s)

Engine has multiple stages, most important are plasma generation and heating / ejection. Efficiency of the engine depends on how much power goes to which one.

Energy can come from solar or nuclear. Configurations using 200-400MW of power.

Can supply thrust to ISS, do asteroid mining and deflection, missions to Saturn moons and beyond solar system.

Has specific impulse of 2500 sec now, 5000 sec possible.

Plan for pushing a meteor from collision course with Earth. A ship used for that would have two VESMIR engines in opposing directions, one to push the meteor without touching it and the other to stabilize the ship. Would run on solar power. To push a 7 M tones asteroid, ship weight would be 4 T, 5 T propellant to catch the asteroid, 30T to push it over.

Launch vehicle - SLS, or Falcon Heavy. SLS cargo to LEO is 70-130 T [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System) and Falcon Heavy's cargo to LEO is 64 T.

## Dlaczego mało pamiętasz ze szkoły

[Kotarski na TEDx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t-sG8FhC4E)

Szkoła jest wynaleziona przez prusów w 19 wieku, żeby z ludzi zrobić posłuszny plebs.

Uczenie przez tłumaczenie i pokazywanie, a nie robienie nie działa i jest bardzo nienaturalna dla mózgu.

Radek obczaił metody uczenia się, które angażują mózg i ciekawość i nauczył się szwedzkiego w 6 miesięcy. Napisał o tym książkę.
