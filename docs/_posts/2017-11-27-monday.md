## You live in a pixel
[Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html)

When something nice happens, you quickly get used to it and go back to your baseline. It's hard to see where you are from a single day (pixel) perspective. Dingle pixel will always look mundane, need to accept that and learn to look at the bigger picture.

Proven ways to feel better:
- sport, sleeping well, meeting with people
- [happy thoughts](http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2012/08/here-are-the-things-that-are-proven-to-make-y/)


## Mentally subtracting positive events

[Research paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2746912/)

Thinking about how a positive event could easily be missed, or could never have happened makes people more happy that just thinking about the event.

People can't predict this effect correctly.

## Virginity test in Indonesian army
[Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/22/indonesia-no-end-abusive-virginity-tests)

Before joining Indonesian army women are tested for virginity, to determine their morality.

Virginity tests are a violation of human rights, "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment".

## Net neutrality competition

[Article on Foundation for Economic Education](https://fee.org/articles/goodbye-net-neutrality-hello-competition/)

Net neutrality blocks competition between ISPs, cheaper bandwidth and more services.

Big ISPs like it because entry level for potential competition is high and there's no "small piece" of market that would be easy to enter.

Surprisingly Google, Facebook, Amazon and other big companies want to keep NN around too. Why?

## Dividing by 0

$$
lim^+ (\frac 1 {+0}) = +\infty
\\
lim^- (\frac 1 {-0}) = -\infty
$$

Depending on from which side do we approach limes, it's plus or minus infinity - the value is undefined.

\\( 0^0 \\) is undefined, because it breaks for complex numbers.

\\( \frac 0 0 \\)  - in the middle of XY plane, can have a lim of any value, depending on what angle do we approach it from.
