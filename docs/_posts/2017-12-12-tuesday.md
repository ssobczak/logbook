## Matplotlib colors
Seaborn provides color generators: hls ``sns.hls_palette(n_colors=6, h=0.01, l=0.6, s=0.65)`` and husl - corrected for human perception of brightness. We see greens as brighter and blues as darker.

```python
palette = sns.hls_palette(8, l=.6)
df.plot(kind='bar', color=palette)
```
