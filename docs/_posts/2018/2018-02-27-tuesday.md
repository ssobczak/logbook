## Diapers

The layer close to the skin facilitates capillary action - one directional, from large to small channels, away from the skin. Then a polymer is trapping liquid.

## Stereolithography 3D Printer

Printer draws objects from the pool of ink upside down. It uses ink that solidifies under UV light. It shines the light from the bottom, trough a silicone window, that allows oxygen in. Oxygen inhibits ink solidification, so the print doesn't stick to the mirror.

Ink is made from mono and oligomer particles, curing agent and UV blocker, to keep the print resolution and not allow UV to go too deep.

Light is steered using DLP mirror array.

## DLP Projector

LCD projector shines light trough clear LCD screen(s). There are light losses.

DLP shines light on a mirror micro-array. Mirrors in the array are directed using electrostatic force.

The color is created by a color wheel spinning in front of the light source, creating R, G, B frames one after another.

Brightness of pixels cannot be controlled, so the mirror will be on only for a percentage of time during a frame to get a darker pixel. Some run at 16K fps.

Grayness is achieved by offset clear pulse modulation and dynamic dithering.
