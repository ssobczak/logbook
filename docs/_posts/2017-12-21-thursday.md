## Types of ice

"Normal" ice has a hexadecimal crystal structure. Depending on a pressure and temperature, 15 crystalline structures are possible for solidifying water. They probably occur on other planets. [Ice II can be made at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obJQtDQRolE)

Freezing water has really big pressure - can crack cannons and most of steel/iron containers. Historically it was hard to do. [Freezing Water in Unbreakable Containers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8el7Iqe2qo)

## Python time series class
[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/manipulating-time-series-data-in-python). Maybe I should do an hour of a class every day at work?

## Organ donation matching / bartering market
[Freakonomics podcast](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/make-match-rebroadcast/)

Al Roth got a Nobel price in economics for work on bartering markets and matching markets.

He worked on admission process for medical students getting internships. Students select interview with multiple hospitals, then choose "preferred" employers. Hospitals do the same and system matches. This works because all students start at the same time and all med. internships are pretty similar. Probably would work with legal, but not everywhere else.

Al also worked on kidney donation matching system. If you need a kidney and your spouse is willing to donate, but you're not a match, their kidney can be swapped with other pair. There's a big system matching donations into big chains (circles?) fo swaps. So far  the biggest was 36 transplants.

Roth didn't try to solve kidney transplant problem - he was teaching a theoretical model of barter market based on home swap example. He was looking for a more realistic example and he found organ donations.
