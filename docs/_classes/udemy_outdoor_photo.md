[Class on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/how-to-be-a-professional-outdoor-and-nature-photographer)

## The Profession of Outdoor and Nature Photography
**1. Intro to Professional Outdoor Photography**

Outdoor photography is one of the most competitive. Unlike wedding, the photographer needs to create the product and then sell it.

**2. Are You Sure You Want to Go Pro?**

Going pro not necessarily will pay for your passion - more business, costs, stress. Doing this for fun means no stress and sometimes easier to afford the travel.

## Introduction to the Business of Outdoor and Nature Photography
**3. The 10 Commandments of Professional Photography**

- Plan what exactly you want to do.
- Decide what products you will have.
- Who will pay you? Corp. or enthusiasts?
- Explain what will the client get (example: video describing workshop).
- Automate sales.
- Meet deadlines.
- Have a marketing strategy.
- Pricing - value or volume?
- Markets - approach businesses for free, or bartering - photos for services.
- Work-life balance.

**4. Should You Be a Specialist or Generalist**

Always be specialist and market as specialist. Can be topic & area. Have a theme in portfolio.

Traveling to a remote destination you're competing with locals that have more time and no costs.

Client will take the specialist for the job, but then ask you to shoot other types of pics on the job - be able to do all those too.

**5. Understanding Outdoor Stock Photography**

Generic and timeless pictures, like Marylin Monroe, or a waterfall.

Keep in mind clothing and gear styles - they expire. Remove all logos and copyrighted symbols from the pics.

**6. Whose Going to Buy Your Outdoor Photography?**

People with tight deadlines, but mostly people that want concept photos (teamwork) rather than specific shots.

**7. Outdoor Photography Concepts**

Non-verbally convey a message. Don't have to be pretty pictures.

For example: success - sky views, challenge - extreme sports.

Keywords are very important.

Photoshop is really useful for expressing concepts.

Big landscapes benefit from light at low angle (morning and evening), as it casts shadows and emphasizes textures.
Soft vs contrasty light.
Light in the front / side / back of the subject.
For sun flares - place sun behind a tree or sth. Also, high f stop will give a star effect.

The more you know about a topic, the better photos.

**37. Should You Be an Adventure Travel Generalist or Specialist?**
Sometimes to get a good shot, you need to participate in the sport. Sometimes it's better to stand aside.
If you're doing a sport, it's easy to become specialist in it.

**38. The Markets for Adventure Photography**
There are niche magazines for each of the outdoor sports. Also local associations, visitor center, product manufacturers etc.
Remove logos from clothing.
Magazines won't buy a single image - they buy from specialists, better to build a portfolio first.

Compose for emotions & storytelling.
What light works for the mood? Contrasty, flat or edge?

Also try keeping the background still and let the subject move.
Water blur.
In some cases freezing works well, especially for nice backgrounds or good compositions, or front facing.

Take or make an adventure. Make = get people to do it for you.
Model needs to be good at their sport. Professional clients can spot the difference. Also won't get noobs to do the cool things. Not the case for family / moody shots.
Ask people that are doing an activity for a permission, offer prints.
Talk with people in a sports shop - they can do the sport (or know the people). They can also recommend a location.
Can offer 20% of sales from an image.

Keep marketing regularly. Editors don't do instagram/facebook.

When you have followers, think about why are they following you.

**91. Websites**
Don't skimp on pro looking website.
Site should be searchable + SEO & blog.
Set image usage rights (stockboxphoto.com - example of pricing & rights).

**92. Email & Direct Mail Marketing**
Email and DM is one of the best tools for photo marketing. Idea: self-publish postcards or small calendar and offer to send it for free to anyone interested.

Design a page with 5-8 images. Hire a graphic designer to design it, to appeal to other designers.

Copy: show some work and convince them that they want more

**93. Your Portfolio and Portfolio Presentations**
Have a common theme. Printed portfolio books. No excuses for the images.

Let the client explain what they need. You want to leave with them liking you. Leave something for them to remember.

Pricing can be fixed by the customer (we pay X per image), or can be set by photographer.

Avg prices for:

- mid stock - $40 x 5M volume = 200M
- micro stock - $6 x 44M volume = **264M**
- subscription - $1.25 x 130M volume = 162M

Niche, specialized photographers have higher prices.

**98. Royalty Free vs. Rights Managed Licenses**

RF - nice image on a normal day, many similar on the web
RM - rare, special situation (thunder over grand canyon)

**99. Microstock**

RM is still there. Microstock is hard to earn money, Need to keep cost down.

Avg commission per photo is $\$0.50 - $\$1 per photo. Small trip for $300 is hard to return.

**100. Establishing Usage Fees 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**
Ask how/where/how long/for how long is the image going to be used.

Estimate how many views - national vs local magazine.
What size? Billboard or quarter page?
Re-runs are worth half of the original run.
What rights? One time shared use, or many times, exclusive? Industry-exclusive?
Unique image - search for similars.
Costs of producing an image.

[Example pricing](https://ssobczak.github.io/logbook/assets/pricing-schedule.pdf)

**108. Negotiating the Sale 1 & 2**

Emphasize value received by the client and base prices on that.
Multi-image discount. Clients usually say that they can buy the same photo from someone else at a lower price.

Don't stress the costs, but the value. Clients usually don't stress about absolute value, but about paying too much.

Photo credit is worthless, but can be a way to lower price while saving face & not be weak.

"I can get the same image for the same price" - this is usually false, but don't be cynical. Thank for contacting you.
