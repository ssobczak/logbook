If you have a good relationship with your child, it's individual and allows the child to develop in the direction it wants.

Morality is derived from society. For example chimpanzees: it's not the meanest, tyrannical chimp that's on the top of hierarchy. If he doesn't have a good social ties, two weaker ones will take it down. Same with wolfs.

Animals don't fight for dominance, they evolved very specific mechanisms to figure out the hierarchy. This is good for the top (no killing) and for the bottom - they're getting threatened, not harmed.

Rats will work to get into play with other rats. Their motivation can be measured by attaching a spring to its tail. Motivation and will to escape can be compared and added up (cat odor where the rat is) and they will pull even harder. Life skill: put negative motivation behind to push you away, instead of inhibiting your actions. That's why it's better to choose a challenge yourself rather than be forced into bad situation - it triggers a different psycho-physiological response. Go and kill a dragon in its liar instead of waiting for it to come after you.

If a smaller rat is paired with a bigger one, the second time the smaller one will do an invitation to play. This also works with kids - they need rough & tumble play. You check the same skills during dancing - you want them to have control of their body and be able to inter-play with others.

If you pair the same rats repeatedly, the morality arises - big rat needs to let the little one to win at least 30%, otherwise they will not want to play. If rats don't get to play, their pre-frontal cortex doesn't develop and they get ADHD.

Best strategy for repeated interactions (simulated): trust, if the rules are violated - punish, but then forgive and start again.

Morality emerges before the representation of morality. Infants can play peak-a-boo. 7 year olds playing marbles can't articulate the rules - part of the games is pushing the rules and have the group decide if it's ok. They have patterns of behavior, not strict rules.

If there's something you want, you need 5 arguments why - if someone is opposing you, they will not have it thought trough this deep. Also useful for relationship with self - mind will be objecting. Sometimes your brain is sneaky - it will give you something easier, but still useful to do instead. Don't practice what you don't want to become - whatever gets dopamine gets built into the brain permanently.

Fantasies and dreams are problem identification tools (pay attention to them) and they may contain a potential solution too.
