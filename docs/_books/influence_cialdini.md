# Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion
by Robert B. Cialdini

## Weapons of Influence

### Automatic response

Turkey mother will care for chicks making chirp sounds. Even if it's made by a predator.

The same automatic behavior works with humans. Examples:
- price of jewelry multiplied by 2
- in a line to xerox machine: giving a reason (people just like having reason). The trigger word is "because", no need for a real reason.

Cleaning fish trigger not-moving of bigger fish by a dance. Small predators do the same dance and bite  off a piece of the big fish.

### Contrast

When selling two items, start with the overpriced one.
House sales: start with an overpriced,

## Reciprocation rule
Used by companies to give a small gift first (Krishna, mail gifts. supermarket samples).
Socially useful and present in most cultures.
The giver chooses the initial favor and the form of repay.
There's also a pressure to accept the initial gift.
Being in debt causes psychological burden. People pay bask with bigger favors than initial to get rid of the burden.

**Concession** (rejection-and-retreat): the act of decreasing the initial favor can be viewed as a "favor" (offering a way out). People agree to the smaller offer because of reciprocity rule.

Contrast principle - making a request look smaller compared to the previous one. Asking for $10 and then for "only $5" triggers both: contrast and reciprocity.

People that were offered concession and agreed are more happy with the result than people that just agreed to the offer. They think they have influenced the result and feel happy with it and responsible for dictating the terms. They are more likely to comply and agree to later requests.

**Defense** Mentally re-label the requests from reciprocity (standard useful to society) to a "trick". Favors call for re-payment, but tricks don't.

## Commitment and Consistency
People unconsciously try to be consistent with decisions they made. This is socially approved and decreases cognitive burden to the person - make the decision once and don't re-consider every single time.

Toy sales example: companies advertise a toy, getting people to promise it to their children for Christmas. Then the toy is out of stock, so parents buy something else. After Christmas the campaign is re-run, children say "you promised" and parents buy the toy to be consistent.

Getting any kind of compliance is good enough for sales people: call centers getting people to respond to "how are you", activists to get people to put a sticker on a car - helps them to ask for unrelated donations even weeks later, polls to ask people if they're going to vote get people to actually vote.

Prominent example was Chinese prison for American soldiers, where they were asked to criticize capitalism in the smallest ways (name one bad thing), or praise communism. Then their words were published in papers / radio / group discussions, forcing them to internalize that that's who they are. Making their statements public puts even more pressure on people to "own it".

**Written commitments are more effective than verbal ones.**

Initiation ceremonies, from ancient tribes to college fraternities have the same purpose - by the painful, humiliating and pointless ritual show that you want to be a member. Then be consistent with what you did. There's no way to stop the ceremonies, because they ensure the group's survival. The harsher the ceremony, the more members value their membership.

**Don't offer any excuse/way out of commitment.**
Chinese military camps had really small prizes for the essay competitions, to make sure they can't serve as an excuse to the prisoners: "I did it for food". That's also why initiation ceremonies must be meaningless (and not e.g. public service).

Example experiment: children were forbidden to play with a toy. One group "because I'll be angry", the other with no reason. 6 weeks later the children that weren't given a reason still didn't play with the toy, because they invented the reason "within themselves", not because experimenter will be angry.

**Lowball** car sales strategy: offer a car with a big discount, let customer drive it for a day. Once committed they will "grow" additional reasons why they want the car (legs supporting the decision) to be consistent with what he's doing. Finally, say that the discount was a mistake - the customer will still want the car - the decision will probably stand on reasons the customer imagined. Best thing: people feel happy about buying the car even without discount, even if it's a bad deal by then.

**How to say no**
First, recognize the strategy. Consistency is a good thing, just the mindless one is to be avoided.
Collecting consistency for evidence is a mental work, so when thinking about a decision, the 'gut feeling' before we can intellectualize about it. So ask a question "would I do it again" and pay attention to the first thought.

## Social Proof

Canned laughter in TV works (people think content is funnier) even if it's obvious that it's fake - such strong is our instinct to think and do the same as others.

### Case study: cult
Guardian Aliens cult in Chicago was investigated by a group of scientist - incognito members. They believed that end of the world is near and they will be saved by aliens. Were very secretive (passwords, no interviews, not converting / spreading the knowledge) especially just before the doomsday date. When end of the world passed and nothing happened, the 'god' told them that since they were so devoted, he saved the world from destruction. This was not enough, but a little later they were told to publicize the explanation. Thee members were invested into the cult and needed another proof of validity of their believes - social proof. If they can convince others, their believes would become more "true".
