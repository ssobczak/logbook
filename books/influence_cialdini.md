## Introduction

## Chapter 1: Weapons of Influence

### Automatic response

Turkey mother will care for chicks making chirp sounds. Even if it's made by a predator.

The same automatic behavior works with humans. Examples:
- price of jewelry multiplied by 2
- in a line to xerox machine: giving a reason (people just like having reason). The trigger word is "because", no need for a real reason.

Cleaning fish trigger not-moving of bigger fish by a dance. Small predators do the same dance and bite  off a piece of the big fish.

When selling two items, start with the overpriced one.

## Chapter 2: Reciprocation: The Old Give and Take â€¦ and Take
Used by companies to give a small gift first (Krishna, mail gifts. supermarket samples).
Socially useful and present in most cultures.
The giver chooses the initial favor and the form of repay.
There's also a pressure to accept the initial gift.
Being in debt causes psychological burden. People pay bask with bigger favors than initial to get rid of the burden.

**Concession** (rejection-and-retreat): the act of decreasing the initial favor can be viewed as a "favor" (offering a way out). People agree to the smaller offer because of reciprocity rule.

Contrast principle - making a request look smaller compared to the previous one. Asking for $10 and then for "only $5" triggers both: contrast and reciprocity.

People that were offered concession and agreed are more happy with the result than people that just agreed to the offer. They think they have influenced the result and feel happy with it and responsible for dictating the terms. They are more likely to comply and agree to later requests.

**Defense** Mentally re-label the requests from reciprocity (standard useful to society) to a "trick". Favors call for re-payment, but tricks don't.
